NOTE: All addresses you enter in this block are supposed to be runtime addresses. 
If you obtain some of them during static analysis, be sure to add the load offset. 
Some buffers may even only exist at runtime...

Use OpenOCD to halt execution while the input prompt is active. 
You should find yourself in a minimal delay() function 
- check your surroundings with "arm disassemble" to be sure 
(e.g. if you halted at PC 0x12134, you could do "arm disassemble 0x12120 16" to see code for 0x12120--0x12160).

Once you're sure you've interrupted execution at the right place, 
provide the current register values by just pasting the output of the OpenOCD "reg" command.
