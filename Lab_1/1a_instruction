The first assignment deals with the small bootloader that keeps certain parts of our Pi Linux installation sealed away 
unless it is unlocked with the correct passphrase. 
Your goal is to determine the correct passphrase and to patch the bootloader so the sealed content is available without interaction.

NOTE: All addresses you enter in this block are supposed to be runtime addresses. 
If you obtain some of them during static analysis, be sure to add the load offset. Some buffers may even only exist at runtime...



Before you start interacting with the bootloader, inspect the binary itself for a moment. 
The tools from GNU Binutils are very handy for this task. 
There is a suspicious-looking string in the binary that fully qualifies as a passphrase: 
quite long, lots of special characters, letters, numbers... sadly it's only a passphrase template, not the actual one.

Please extract that passphrase template and enter it here.
