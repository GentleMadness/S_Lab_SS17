This assignment will finally get you a shell on the Raspberry. There are many ways to pass a signature check: 
violating the signature format (thus possibly triggering a bug in the check function), 
finding a hash collision (so a benign signature acquired beforehand also pertains to your crafted data), 
or obtaining private key material. In this case you'll do the latter.
===============================================================================================================================

There is a network service on the board that accepts a certain kind of signed message to install new authentication data. 
Your first task is to find that service. 
Scan the board for open ports, then try connecting to the ports you identified until you hit the right one. 
Don't worry, it will be obvious when you've found it.

Please enter the protocol and port number here, e.g. tcp:8080.
