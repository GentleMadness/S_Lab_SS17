This assignment will finally get you a shell on the Raspberry. There are many ways to pass a signature check: 
violating the signature format (thus possibly triggering a bug in the check function), 
finding a hash collision (so a benign signature acquired beforehand also pertains to your crafted data), 
or obtaining private key material. In this case you'll do the latter.


We've been able to identify the list of valid keys for signing; 
you can grab a copy at <http://seclab.sec.t-labs.tu-berlin.de/keys>.
Analyze the data and provide a list of all RSA key moduli in the usual format:
N = 0x12345678....
N = 0x23456789....
