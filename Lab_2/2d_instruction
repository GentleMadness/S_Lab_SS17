This assignment will finally get you a shell on the Raspberry. 
There are many ways to pass a signature check: 
violating the signature format (thus possibly triggering a bug in the check function), 
finding a hash collision (so a benign signature acquired beforehand also pertains to your crafted data), 
or obtaining private key material. In this case you'll do the latter.


Compute all components of the RSA private key using the prime factor you found, 
and list them in the usual format. P and Q are basically interchangeable, but for this assignment assume that P < Q. 
If you don't know what some of these items mean, 
feel free to consult Wikipedia or any other reference on the RSA algorithm (and its CRT calculation shortcut):
N = 0x12345678....
P = 0x24354657....
Q = 0x33445566....
E = 0x343...
D = 0x56785678....
DP = 0x14141414....
DQ = 0x28282828....
PINV = 0x23231414....
