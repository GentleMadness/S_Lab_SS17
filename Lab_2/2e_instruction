This assignment will finally get you a shell on the Raspberry. 
There are many ways to pass a signature check: 
violating the signature format (thus possibly triggering a bug in the check function), 
finding a hash collision (so a benign signature acquired beforehand also pertains to your crafted data), 
or obtaining private key material. In this case you'll do the latter.

Use the script available at <http://seclab.sec.t-labs.tu-berlin.de/comp2key.py> to assemble your components into a usable key. 
Then create a message according to the specification of the service you found in 2a to install your login credentials on the Pi.
Upload a hexdump of your message (data plus detached signature) which you obtained by running

hexdump -v -e '1/1 "%02x"' $YOURMESSAGEFILE

The result should be a continuous stream of hexadecimal characters, no line breaks, no spaces etc.
